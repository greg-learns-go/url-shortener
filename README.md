# url-shortener

This is a project to learn GO.

The objective: self contained app, including a server, that can
- save new URL, and respond with a short version on POST requests
- retrieve a shortened URL on GET, and redirect
- covered with unit tests
- flags specifying domain/port

Bonus points:
- compile an executable for other platforms? (Mac, Windows?)
- deploy the executable in some hosting?
